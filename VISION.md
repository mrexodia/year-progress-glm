> The design soul of Year Progress — what it should feel like, look like, and evoke.

---

## The Emotional Core

**This app is a moment of stillness.**

In the rush of daily life, days blur together. Weeks vanish. Suddenly it's October and you're wondering where the year went.

Year Progress is a gentle nudge to pause and notice. To see the year laid out before you — days passed, days remaining. To mark the moments that mattered. To recognize that time is passing, and that's okay.

**It should feel like:**
- Opening a favorite journal
- A deep breath
- A cozy corner with soft light
- Something that makes you smile

**It should NOT feel like:**
- A productivity tracker demanding input
- A cold, techy dashboard
- Something stressful or guilt-inducing
- An obligation

## Visual Identity

### Aesthetic: Soft Kawaii Minimalism

Clean and simple, but warm and joyful. Think: the lovechild of a bullet journal and a Studio Ghibli background.

**Key characteristics:**
- Soft, rounded shapes (no harsh corners)
- Gentle shadows and subtle depth
- Plenty of breathing room (whitespace)
- Playful but not childish
- Cute without being cluttered

### Color Philosophy

**Pastels are the heart of this design.**

Colors should feel like:
- A spring morning
- Cotton candy clouds
- Watercolor paintings
- Soft blankets

**Never:**
- Harsh or neon
- High contrast that hurts the eyes
- Dark/moody (even dark themes should be soft)
- Corporate or sterile

## The Grid: Heart of the App

The dot grid is everything. It should be beautiful even before any interaction.

**Layout:**
- Days arranged in rows of 7 (like a calendar week)
- ~52 rows showing the full year
- Subtle month separations (slightly more spacing, not harsh lines)
- Current day gently highlighted (soft glow or ring)

**Dots themselves:**
- Perfectly round
- Satisfying size (big enough to tap easily, small enough to see the whole year)
- Past days: Filled with theme color
- Future days: Very subtle outline or ghost of the color
- Today: Soft pulsing glow or gentle highlight
- Marked days: User's chosen color/emoji visible

**Interaction states:**
- Hover/focus: Subtle grow effect
- Tapped: Gentle bounce
- Marked: Satisfying visual confirmation

---

## Typography

**Feeling:** Friendly, readable, slightly playful

**Recommendations:**
- Primary font: Rounded sans-serif (Nunito, Quicksand, or Varela Round)
- Numbers: Should feel friendly, not cold
- Size: Generous and readable
- Weight: Medium to slightly bold — soft, not harsh

**Hierarchy:**
- Year title: Large, centered, proud but not shouty
- Progress stats: Smaller, gentle, informative
- Day notes: Personal, slightly different feel (could be slightly different font)

---

## Micro-interactions & Delight

Small moments that spark joy:

**Opening the app:**
- Dots could gently fade in from center outward
- Or a soft "bloom" effect
- Should feel like the app is waking up and greeting you

**Marking a day:**
- Tapping opens a small, cute popup
- Color/emoji options arranged in a pleasing way
- Selection should feel satisfying (subtle bounce, gentle haptic on supported devices)
- Closing the popup: Smooth, not jarring

**Progress updates:**
- When a new day passes, gentle transition
- No jarring changes — everything flows

**Scrolling/navigation:**
- Buttery smooth
- No janky movements
- Feels like sliding on silk

---

## Empty States & Edge Cases

Even "empty" should be beautiful:

**Start of year (January 1):**
- Nearly all dots empty
- Celebratory feeling: "A fresh year awaits!"
- Perhaps a tiny sparkle or star effect

**End of year (December 31):**
- Grid beautifully filled
- Reflective feeling: "What a year it's been"
- Prompt to export memories

**No marks yet:**
- Gentle invitation: "Tap any day to mark it"
- Should not feel like failure or emptiness

---

## Accessibility & Inclusivity

Beauty that everyone can experience:

- **Color choices:** Pastel doesn't mean invisible — ensure sufficient contrast
- **Touch targets:** Dots must be easily tappable (minimum 44px)
- **Text size:** Respect system font size preferences
- **Motion:** Reduce animations for users who prefer reduced motion
- **Screen readers:** Proper labels ("Day 45 of 365, February 14, marked as happy")

## What Success Looks Like

When someone opens Year Progress, they should:

1. **Smile** — it's cute and makes them happy
2. **Understand instantly** — no explanation needed
3. **Want to interact** — tapping a day feels inviting
4. **Feel calm** — not stressed or overwhelmed
5. **Come back** — it becomes a small ritual they enjoy

## Final Words
